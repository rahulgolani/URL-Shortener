SAVING THE DATA TO A JSON FILE

json is a data interchanging format


MESSAGE FLASHING

flash function from flask

{% for message in get_flashed_messages() %}
<h2>{{message}}</h2>
{% endfor %}

set secret_key in main.py


CREATING ROUTES FOR URL SHORT NAMES

new route just as post slug

DISPLAY CUSTOM ERROR MESSAGES

to handle error 404 we can use abort function from flask

return abort(404)



now we get flask defined error whenever we go to the slug not defined in the json file
we can create a error handler in flask as a new route
#for which error you want to create a handler
@app.errorhandler(404)
def page_not_found(error):
return render_template("page_not_found.html"),404

IMPLEMENTING SESSIONS AND COOKIES

to retain the information which the user has entered in the pasts

* A session is the time interval when a client logs into a server and logs out of it
* A session with each client is assigned a session Id
* To use a session we must use a secret key
* The session object in flask is used to set the session and get the session data
* The data of the session is stored in the client browser as a cookie
* Cookie is a text file of a client session stored on a browser
* Its purpose is to remember and track the data pertaining to client's usage
